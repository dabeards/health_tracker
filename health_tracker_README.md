#Health Tracker

In this assignment our goal was to create an app where we could input various sets of data about our health to keep track of our health.
We have several categories we kept track of that included:
- caloric intake
- performed exercises
- step Count
- weight
Each of these categories has a page with forms for inputting the health-tracking data. Also there is a dashboard page with links to all the pages where the information is input.
We have a few methods to calculate statistics on the health data as well.
Finally this app is the first app we uploaded to heroku to be hosted live on the internet.

##The Details
We use scaffold to generate the models, views, and controllers for caloric intake and for performed exercises.
We hand-built everything for step count and weight and exercise types.

The link for the app is located at:
